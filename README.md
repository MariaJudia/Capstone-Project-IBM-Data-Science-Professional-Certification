Scope:
Berlin and Hamburg are Germany's two largest cities. While Berlin is counting roughtly 3.6 million inhabitants and Hamburg roughtly 1.8 million, both cities are quite different. Berlin is filled with an eclectic mix of history, culture and gorgeous sights, it’s a city that intrigues yet embraces visitors with open arms. The city is bursting with internationality as a result of many new residents from all over the world. Germany’s second city, Hanseatic Hamburg is both typically German and unique in its own way. With a long maritime history, this North Sea port city has a distinct feel from anywhere else in the country and tons of cool things to see and do.

Both cities beeing in the northern part of Germany, there is a great exchange between residents of both cities. This analysis is intended to show which areas of one city resemble those of the other: Berlin and Hamburg.
